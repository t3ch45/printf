# **0x11. C - printf**
<br>
<br>
# **Description**
<br>
This function _printf is a replica of the printf function, created for pair programming for ALX Holberton School.
The function *printf* produces an output according to the format specified by the user.
<br>
**Concepts to learn from the project:**
<br>
1. How to use git in a team.
<br>
2. Applying variadic functions to a big project.
<br>
3. The complexities of printf
<br>
4. Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow.

# **Prototype**
<br>
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
<br>
<br>
# **Usage**
<br>
In C programming language, printf() function is used to print the (“character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values”) onto the output screen.
<br>
* Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
* Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
* Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters
<br>
# **Examples**
<br>
1. _printf("Hello World\n") prints: Hello World, followed by a new line.
<br>
2. _printf("Christiano Ronaldo plays number %d", 7) prints: Christiano Ronaldo plays number 7

# **Tasks**
<br>
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
<br>
* Write a function that produces output according to a format.
<br>
* c : converts input into a character
<br>
* s : converts input into a string
<br>
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
<br>
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
<br>
 * d : converts input into a base 10 integer
<br>
 * i : converts input into an integer
<br>
2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel
<br>
* Create a man page for your function
<br>
3. With a face like mine, I do better in print
<br>
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
<br>
 * b : the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
<br>
4. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
<br>
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
<br>
 * u : converts the input into an unsigned integer
<br>
 * o : converts the input into an octal number
<br>
 * x : converts the input into a hexadecimal number
<br>
 * X : converts the input into a hexadecimal number with capital letters
 <br>
5. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
<br>
* Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
<br>
6. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
<br>
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
<br>
 * S : prints the string
<br>
 * Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
 <br>
7. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
<br>
* Handle the following conversion specifier:
<br>
 * p : int input is converted to a pointer address
 <br>
8. The big print gives and the small print takes away
<br>
* Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
<br>
 * + : adds a + in front of signed positive numbers and a - in front of signed negative numbers
<br>
 * space : same as +, but adds a space (is overwritten by +)
<br>
 * # : adds a 0 in front of octal conversions that don't begin with one, and a 0x or 0X for x or X conversions
 <br>
9. Sarcasm is lost in print
<br>
* Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
<br>
 * l : converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in short signed or unsigned ints
<br>
 * h : converts d, i, u, o, x, X conversions in long signed or unsigned ints
<br>
10. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
<br>
* Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
<br>
11. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
<br>
* Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
<br>
12. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
<br>
* Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
<br>
13. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection
<br>
* Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
<br>
14. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
<br>
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
<br>
 * r : prints the reversed string
<br>
15. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring
<br>
* Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
<br>
 * R : prints the rot13'ed string
 <br>
[16. * ]
* All the above options work well together.
